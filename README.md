# Bigg Ontology

![Ontology](resources/ontology.png)

## Project Description

This ontology is designed to represent the domain of buildings energy measurements. It provides a formal structure to
describe buildings, consumptions, weather, KPIs, and their relationships.

### Purpose and Objectives

- **Purpose**: Facilitate the organization and tracking of projects through a structured and formalized representation.
- **Objectives**: Establish a formal framework for describing and categorizing different aspects of buildings and urban
  areas. This will enhance our comprehension and management of urban elements, streamline building management, promote
  interoperability between systems, and lay the groundwork for creating data-driven analysis and visualization tools.
  Ultimately, this will simplify the analysis process and support the design of policies and strategies for sustainable
  urban development.

### Motivations

- Complexity of Urban Environments: The intricate nature of urban areas necessitates a comprehensive framework to manage
  and analyze various elements effectively.
- Data Integration: The need to integrate disparate data sources and systems to provide a cohesive understanding of
  urban environments.
- Sustainability Goals: The growing emphasis on sustainable development requires precise tools for planning and managing
  urban growth.
- Technological Advancements: Leveraging new technologies to improve data collection, analysis, and visualization.
- Policy Development: The demand for robust data-driven insights to inform urban policy and decision-making.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `ontology/`
    - `ontology.ttl`: Main ontology file in Turtle format.
- `extensions/`
    - `tariff.ttl`: Bigg ontology extension for Tariff in Turtle format.
    - `bigg4kpi.ttl`: Bigg ontology extension for energy kpi in Turtle format.
- `schema/`
    - `BiggOntology.drawio`: UML schema of the ontology.
