## Project Description
This ontology is designed to represent the domain of buildings energy measurements. It provides a formal structure to describe buildings, consumptions, weather, KPIs, and their relationships.

### Purpose and Objectives
- **Purpose**: Facilitate the organization and tracking of projects through a structured and formalized representation.
- **Objectives**: Improve buildings management, facilitate interoperability between systems, and provide a basis for developing data driven analysis and visualization tools.

### Motivations
- Crear una ontologia que permita caracterizar tanto edificios como zonas urbanas para su posterior analisis.

## Repository Structure

- `ontology/`
  - `ontology.ttl`: Main ontology file in Turtle format.
